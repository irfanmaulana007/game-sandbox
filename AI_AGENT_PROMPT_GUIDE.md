- Critical hit system with defense resistance
```

## üîß Specific Implementation Prompts

- Defense reduction and critical resistance
- Battle rewards (experience, gold, items)
- Battle logging and history
```

### Character System
```
Create a character management system for an RPG game including:
- Character creation with job classes
- Stat allocation system (1 point per level)

- Job-based stat progression
- Character status management
- Equipment integration
```

### Equipment System
```
Implement an equipment system for an RPG game with:
- Equipment types (weapon, armor, accessory)
- Rarity system (common to legendary)
- Stat bonus calculations
- Equipping/unequipping mechanics
- Slot management (weapon, armor, accessory1, accessory2)
- Level requirements
```

## üìä Data Model Prompts

### Character Data Structure
```
Create TypeScript interfaces and database models for RPG characters including:
- Base character information (name, job, level, experience, gold)
- Character status (health, attack, defense, speed, critical)
- Job classes with base stats and level bonuses
- Equipment integration
- Inventory management
```

### Battle Data Structure
```
Design data structures for the RPG battle system:
- Battle entities (character and monster)
- Turn order calculation
- Damage calculation results
- Battle logs and history
- Battle rewards and outcomes
```

## üöÄ API Development Prompts

### REST API Structure
```
Create a complete REST API for an RPG game with these endpoints:
- Authentication: /api/auth/register, /api/auth/login
- Characters: /api/characters (CRUD operations)
- Equipment: /api/equipment (management and equipping)
- Monsters: /api/monsters (battle encounters)
- Maps: /api/maps (location information)
- Battle: /api/battle (combat system)
- Inventory: /api/inventory (item management)

Include proper validation, error handling, and authentication middleware.
```

### API Documentation
```
Generate comprehensive API documentation for an RPG game backend including:
- Endpoint descriptions and parameters
- Request/response examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes and messages
- Rate limiting information
- Testing examples
```

## üß™ Testing Prompts

### Unit Testing
```
Create unit tests for RPG game backend services:
- Battle mechanics (damage calculation, turn order)
- Character system (stat allocation, leveling)
- Equipment system (stat bonuses, equipping)
- Authentication system
- Database operations
```

### Integration Testing
```
Develop integration tests for RPG game backend:
- API endpoint functionality
- Database operations and relationships
- Authentication flows
